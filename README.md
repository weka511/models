## skins

Model the rules that some Aboriginal groups have created to preserve animals.

Several years agoo I was struck by a description of the rules for conserving totem animals, which show evidence of having been designed very carefully. This model is intended as a respectful exploration of the rules, to verify my belief that they ensure stability of the population.

There are two types of rules.

 * Who may eat which types of animal
 * Who may marry whom, and the *skin* associated with the offspring.

### Who may eat which types of animal

Each person has a "skin". They may not eat the animal associated with that skin, and they must protect the breeding ground associated with their animal by any means at all.

### Who may marry whom, and the *skin* associated with the offspring.

 * Everyone belongs to a *skin*
 * The husband and wife must be from different skins; a male can martry a female from one specified skin, only, and vice versa.
 * The child belongs to a different skin again, which is deetrmined by the skins of the father and mother.

Some examples of rules may be found at [the Wikipedia page on Aboriginal Kinship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_kinship)
