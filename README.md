## skins

Model the rules that some Aboriginal groups have created to preserve animals.

Several years agoo I was struck by a description of the rules for conserving totem animals, which show evidence of having been designed very carefully. This model is intended as a respectful exploration of the rules, to verify my belief that they ensure stability of the population.

There are two types of rules.

 * Who may eat which types of animal
 * Who may marry whom, and the *skin* associated with the offspring.

### Who may eat which types of animal

Each person has a "skin". They may not eat the animal associated with that skin, and they must protect the breeding ground associated with their animal by any means at all.

### Who may marry whom, and the *skin* associated with the offspring.

 * Everyone belongs to a *skin*
 * The husband and wife must be from different skins; a male can marry a female from one specified skin, only, and vice versa.
 * The child belongs to a different skin again, which is determined by the skins of the father and mother.

Some examples of rules may be found at [the Wikipedia page on Aboriginal Kinship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_kinship). Here is an example from the Martuthunira language of the Western Pilbara.


|Section name (female)|Marries (male)|Children|

|Purungu|Pal.yarri|Panaka|

### Research Question

Is this system stable? If we start with a group of people from a "reasonable" micx of skins, plus "enough" animals, will the rules give a fluctuating population in which no people or food anaimals go extinct?
